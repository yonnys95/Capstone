          <h2>HOW WE DID IT</H2>
          To achieve the results State Farm required, our team worked on
          different aspects of the analysis and research, as well as the
          creation of the website. Early in the semester, Alex Carney got an
          early start on writing a program using the coding language Python,
          that retrieved, processed, cleaned and analyzed tweets that had to do
           with State Farm. It was important that we got this code working
           quickly and correctly because this code allowed our team to find and
           store all of the tweets that we would need for analysis. Alex used
           various Python libraries including Textblob, GetOldTweets3, and
           Preprocessor. Alex had to piece together these libraries in order to
           create his own script that was not bound by the limitations of the
           Twitter API, which limits the amount of tweets that you can pull off
           of Twitter in a certain amount of time. These libraries also allowed
           our team to account for emojis in tweets, which is not something that
           is usually considered in sentiment analysis. We felt that adding
           sentiment scores to emojis not only set us apart from other sentiment
           analysis, but enabled us to have a more accurate view of the overall
           tweet. In total, our program retrieved upwards of 133,000 tweets that
            were about State Farm. Once we had accurate and clean data to work
            with, Amanda Delargy worked with Python and R program to create an
            interactive graph with a range slider that shows the public opinion
            of State Farm over a set period of time. We felt that having an
            interactive graph would be beneficial to the person interpreting it
            because it offers a deeper understanding of the material as well as
            making the webpage more interesting instead of just text and
            pictures of graphs. Amanda used the Python libraries known as Pandas
            , Matplotlib and Plotly. This allowed her to turn our CSV file full
            of tweets into a dataframe so that it could be more easily
            manipulated. This dataframe was then turned into a line graph and
            made interactive by utilizing the Python libraries previously
            mentioned. Emma Bradley, Yonny Sohn and Jake Walter then took this
            information and created a website, with Emma and Yonny focusing on
            the back end development of the website and Jake focusing on front
            end. By delegating different responsibilities to different members
            of the group, our team was able to finish our project in a timely
            manner. Our team did not have many problems during this project
            because of clear communication as well as reaching all of the goals
            that our group had previously set for themselves so that we would be
            on track and not fall behind. Overall, our team created a useful and
            interesting way to showcase customer feedback for State Farm.
