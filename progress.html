          To acheive the research and results Statefarm needed, each one of us
          worked on different aspects of this analysis.

          <br> To begin, Alex Carney wrote a program in the Python language that
          retrieved, processed, cleaned, and analyzed the tweets. He used various
          libraries including Textblob, GetOldTweets3, and preprocessor.
          The program retrieved upwards of 133,000 tweets and most of my development
          time was focused on piecing together libraries to create his own script
          that wasn't bound by the limitations of the Twitter API.

          <br>Once we had enough data to work with, Amanda Delargy worked with the
          language Python as well to create the time series graph with the
          range slider. In her program, She imported the libraries: pandas,
          matplotlib,and plotly to turn a csv file into a dataframe and then to
          put that dataframe into a line graph. These libraries were also used
          to update the layout of the graph so it would include interactive
          buttons and a range slider.
