          <h2>VIEWING THE RESULTS</h2>
          The results of our project can be viewed in our interactive graph.
          The x axis represents the date, while the y axis represents the
          average sentiment score per day. The dates can be adjusted using the
          slider below the graph, allowing the user to view the average sentiment
          scores over the course of specific amount of time, whether it be a few
          hours or a few years. By looking before, during and after the first
          Sunday of every Feburary for the Superbowl, we can see what the
          general opinion of State Farm is and if their commercials had any
          effects, which would be indicated by a rise or drop in customer
          sentiment. We can also see the general opinion on State Farm for the
          time between January 1st of 2013 and March 28 of 2020. The graph
          depicts that the perception of State Farm is generally positive, with
          the line seldom dipping below zero, indicating a negative sentiment.
          This shows that the sentiment or feelings from customers from the past
           few years towards State Farm has been overall positive.
