          <h2>WHAT IS SENTIMENT ANALYSIS?</h2>
          <br>The rise of social media allows anyone to share their personal
          thoughts and feelings on certain subjects. Oftentimes these comments
           posted to social media detail how the person may feel about a
           business or product. Companies have taken notice of this and have
           been collecting data to get a better understanding on how their
           customers feel towards their company and their products.
         <hr>

          <br>Sentiment analysis is a procedure where words are assigned different
          float values, in this case, between 1 and -1 based on how positive or
          negative  the word is. These float values are then added together to
          determine if the overall chunk of text is generally positive, negative
          or neutral, with 1 being positive, 0 being neutral and -1 being
          negative. Sentiment analysis is extremely useful for businesses who
          would like to identify customer sentiment, also known as a specific
          view or  attitude, towards a service, brand or particular product.
          Sentiment analysis is invaluable for any company that wants to
          quantify subjective information in text in order to know how their
          company is viewed by their customers. Learning what customers like
          and dislike allows companies to pivot towards a more successful and
          accurate business model, leading to increased customer satisfaction.

          <h2>OUR PROJECT</h2>
          <br>For this particular project, our team worked with an insurance company
          named State Farm. Our goal was to grasp the overall perception of
          State Farms customers through sentiment analysis among the social
          media platforms that State Farm is associated with. After researching
          State Farm on different social media platforms such as Facebook,
          Twitter and Instagram, our team decided that Twitter had the most
          authentic and genuine mentions of State Farm and would therefore
          provide a more accurate sentiment analysis. To narrow our sentiment
          analysis even further, our team focused on critical State Farm events,
          specifically State Farm’s popular commercials during the Super Bowl.
          Our team wanted to find out what customers thought about State Farm
          before, during and after they viewed a State Farm commercial during
          the Super Bowl. Specifically, our team wanted to see if customers
          perception of State Farm would change for the better or worse after
          viewing one of their  popular commercials, as well as if the
          commercial would overall positively benefit or negatively impact the
          company. The data our team collected is displayed using graphs created
          in R program and Python so that they can be easily presented to
          State Farm in the form of a website.
          <hr>
          Our teams analysis during this critical event in the companies history
          shows when sentiment was high, indicating public opinion of State Farm
          was positive, and when sentiment was low, indicating that customers
           had a negative view of State Farm. This data is not only valuable
           to state farm, as it allows them to focus on what customers enjoy
           about the company and change the negative aspects that customers do
           not like, but it is also valuable to the customer because the company
           is listening to what the customers are saying and can change their
           business model in order to more accurately fit the customers needs.
           Our website was created in order to showcase this customer sentiment
           towards State Farm.
